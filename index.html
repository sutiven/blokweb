                How much does HelloFresh cost?
              </summary>
              <p>
                The cost of HelloFresh‚Äôs meal service starts at $7.49 per serving.
                In other words, you spend only $53.94 per week for 3 recipes a week
                for 2 people. Just check out our street cred on Trustpilot, where
                our customers swear by our service. For instance, one customer
                claims: 'I LOVE HelloFresh... We saved over $300 a month in
                groceries because we always bought too much food.' Or, as another
                customer puts it: ' We save over $100 a week by not going out to eat
                or even stopping by the grocery store to grab things for dinner!' Of
                course, each customer experience is different. We charge weekly and
                not monthly. We make it easier for you to manage your food budget
                and expenses. Our meal kit service is so convenient you can pause
                and reactivate your account as you please.
